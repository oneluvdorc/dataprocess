    %
    % Calculates distance between two points taken from vectors in the
    % DATA-datastructure. X-coordinates are multiplied with xlength and y with
    % ylength, so that usually normalized 0..1 coordinates can be corrected, if
    % the screen is not rectangular. If the axes are already having similar
    % scales, these parameters can be set to one, when the multiplication does
    % nothing.
