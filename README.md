# dataprocess

Matlab code written in regards to a research project lead by Dr. Minkang Kim from The University of Sydney School of Education and Social Work.

The program is separated into three parts of data manipulation: data preprocessing, main data analysis, and data postprocessing.
The preprocessing and postprocessing programs utilise gazeanalysislib (https://github.com/infant-cognition-tampere/gazeanalysislib) functions developed by researchers from the University of Tampere, Finland. 

The main data analysis code was written and altered to suit our circumstances by Dr. Roy Hessels (https://github.com/royhessels/I2MC/tree/v1.1)
